This is a repository created for various regression analysis.
It is one of the basic advanced statistical concept used in Machine Learning.

Formula is as follows:

Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + ...... + BnXn + E

Y = dependent variable, X1....Xn are independent value, B0 = min threshold value i.e irrespective of anything the dependent variable will have the value.
E = is actually greek letter Epsilon(it is the error of margin)
